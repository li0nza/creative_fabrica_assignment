# creative_fabrica_assesment

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

I assume whoever is looking at this already has flutter setup. If not, head over to https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install.

Just do a `flutter pub get` and `flutter pub run build_runner build` in the project root and you should be good to go.

Use `flutter run` in the project root to run the app on a simulator. I would however recommend using the built in run commands for VS Code or Android Studio
